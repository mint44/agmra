  description: "GMRA classification with different hyperparameters"

data:
  num_points: 2000  # More data for better hyperparameter evaluation
  
gmra:
  leafsize: 5       # Smaller leafsize for more detailed tree
  min_points: 5     # Lower minimum points for more nodes
  thresholds: 0.1   # Higher threshold for basis construction
  
classifiers:
  random_forest:
    n_estimators: 200  # More trees
    max_depth: 10      # Limit depth
    
  svm:
    C: 10.0           # Higher regularization
    gamma: "auto"     # Different gamma setting
